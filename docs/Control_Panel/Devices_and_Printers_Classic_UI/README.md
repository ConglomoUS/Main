# Control Panel - Devices and Printers Classic UI

!!! Note
    Link to the original [repo](https://github.com/ConglomoUS/Control_Panel_Devices_and_Printers_Classic_UI)

Don't you just hate that Microsoft changed the Control Panel icon that goes to Devices and Printers to now go to Settings. 

This repo will create a new Control Panel icon that reverts back to the Classic UI.
